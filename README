##### 0. Be sure, that none of bands is cutted from the bottom (the bottom energy HAS TO be set in the band gap). 
#####    Dont worry if bands are cutted from the top - I can reconstruct it (the top energy HAS NOT TO be set in the band gap)
##### 1. CHANGE COMMAND VARIABLE
##### 2. IN DIRECTORY PUT
#####    a) OUTPUT FILE FROM PREVIOUS CYCLE OF RKKR/RCPA (THE NAME OF FILE DOES NOT MATTER, BECAUSE I MAKE GREP *)
#####    b) copy filei5 or fileo7 to filei50 AND change last number to "999"
##### 3. CALL this program with python2 rkkr-fermi_surface_color_and_symmetry_obiect.py and answer the questions
##### 4. CALL fermisurfer fermi.frsmf

##### Format of file_frmsf:
#first line: nkp x nkp x nkp
#second line: control number
#third line: number of bands
#4-6 lines: reciprocal lattice vectors (in 1/a_B)
#then list of columns:
# 1. E-ef(eV), 2. linewidth (eV) (if rcpa) or band index (if rkkr)
##### Format of file_lifetime_frmsf:
#1-6 lines like in file_frmsf; then
# 1. E-ef(eV), 2. lifetime (ps) (if rcpa) or band index (if rkkr)
##### Format of file_mayavi
#first line: number of kpoints and number of bands; then:
# 1. kx, 2. ky, 3.kz (in 1/a_i units, a_i-lattice constants), 4. E-ef (eV)
